It is lay new basis and got many newness.\r\nMore faster and reliable than Schumix. The code is written in c#.\r\n\r\n# Platforms\r\n\r\nThe bot has compatibility with windows and linux systems.\r\nIt might be run on Mac OS X but it's haven't been tested yet.\r\nUnder Windows the `.NET Framework 4.0` or higher is recommended.\r\nUnder Mono at least the `2.10.8.1` or higher is needed.\r\n\r\n# Run source / Compile\r\n\r\n## SubModule\r\n\r\nDownload missing submodules: git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\n### Monodevelop / Xamarin Studio\r\nWhen using Monodevelop / Xamarin Studio the `gettext` is needed for translating the language files.\r\n<br/>Download and install it. `http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm`\r\n<br/>The compiling is simple. Open the `Schumix.sln` file.\r\n<br/>Choose the configuration that fits for you and compile it.\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio\r\nWhen using Visual Studio you only need to open `SchumixVS.sln`.\r\n<br/>Choose the configuration that fits for you and compile it.\r\n\r\n## Linux\r\n\r\nOpen the `Schumix.sln` file.\r\n<br/>Choose the configuration that fits for you and compile it.\r\n\r\n## Linux terminal\r\n\r\nInstall the `mono-xbuild` package or from source `mono`.\r\n<br/>Than run the `build.sh` command and the code is compiled.\r\n\r\n# Code commissioning\r\n\r\nNavigate to the `Run` folder and than to the appropriate folder for the configuration file.\r\n<br/>Run the exe.\r\n<br/>The program will generate its own config file.\r\n<br/>If any problem occurs then create a `Configs` named folder and copy the `Schumix.yml` file from the `Configs` folder into it.\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\nUse this option only if you want to innstal the bot like a program.\r\n<br/>Attention! Administrative permissions probably needed at the final stage of install.\r\n\r\n## Archlinux\r\n\r\n**Attention!!! Root permission needed for that.**\r\n<br/>Run the `./createarchlinuxpkg.sh` command.\r\n<br/>When it's done a `schumix.pkg.tar.xz` (the name will be similar) named file will be created.\r\n<br/>Install it with the `sudo pacman -U schumix2.pkg.tar.xz` command (the packet name will be similar) and it's all ready.\r\n<br/>Run the bot with the `schumix` command.\r\n\r\n## Debian / Ubuntu\r\n\r\n**Attention!!! Root permission needed for that.**\r\n<br/>For the first step, switch to fakeroot mode.\r\n<br/>Type the `fakeroot` command for that.\r\n<br/>After that run the `./createdebianpkg.sh` command.\r\n<br/>When it's done a `schumix.deb` named file will be created.\r\n<br/>Install it with the `sudo dpkg -i schumix.deb` command and it's all ready.\r\n<br/>Run the bot with the `schumix` command.\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\nNavigate to the Installer folder.\r\n<br/>Run the `Schumix.iss` named file.\r\n<br/>When it's done a `Setup.exe` file will be created.\r\n<br/>Run this and complete the install.\r\n<br/>I guess I don't need to explain more. :)\r\n\r\n# Config settings\r\n\r\nTo adjust the configs navigate to the `Share/doc/Configs` folder and open the `Schumix.md` file.\r\n<br/>This is the description for the main config.\r\n<br/>Reading the description is necessary because the bot can't be started correctly without it.\r\n<br/>After that you can take a look at the other descriptions but they aren't required for starting the bot.\r\n\r\n# Database configuration\r\n\r\n## MySql\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a mysql based database set the `<MySql><Enabled>false</Enabled>` permission to true.\r\n<br/>After that, fill the database from the `Sql` folder.\r\n<br/>If any kind of correction or update will come you don't need to refill the whole database.\r\n<br/>Only update it from the `Updates` folder with the appropriate version number.\r\n\r\n## SQLite\r\n\r\nIf you want to use an SQLite based database set the `<SQLite><Enabled>false</Enabled>` permission to true.\r\n<br/>Then copy the `Schumix.db3` file from the `Sql` folder next to the exe.\r\n<br/>You can rename or move it but you have to change the name or the path in the config file.\r\n<br/>If any kind of correction or update will come you don't need to refill the whole database.\r\n<br/>Only update it from the `Updates` folder with the appropriate version number.\r\n\r\n# Attention!\r\n\r\n**Only one database can be active. If there is'n an active database or there are two active database the code will crash and stop running.**\r\n\r\nIf you are all done with it than you just need to launch and use the code. :)\r\n\r\n# Trivia\r\n\r\n* Usually configuration files belongs to the addons made by me. These are also generated in the `Configs` folder and you can modify them there.\r\n* Furthermore, a bot command was placed in the code. That command composed by the primary name. For example: `schumix2, help`\r\n  The structure of the command is important: `<primary nick>, command`\r\n* There are functions belongs to the code which can be turned on and off. These are controllable by the administrator only.\r\n  Description about the functions: `$help function` (With the configured prefix, of course)\r\n* If it has been already mentioned, you can add admin with the console for first.\r\n  `admin add <admin name>`\r\n  Then you will get a password which have to be sent to the bot in a private message like this: `$admin access <password>`\r\n  If you want to change it than: `$admin newpassword <old> <new>`\r\n* And finally the console commands. You can get the list with te `help` command.\r\n  The rest can be obtained as like the irc commands. Type the name of the command than the subcommand after the help command.\r\n* If anything missed I can help on the `irc.rizon.net` server on the `#schumix, #schumix2` or `#hun_bot` channels.\r\n* In Yaml configs, all the data which contains special characters (#,$) have to be placed between quotation marks \"\" otherwise the program try to    \r\n  interpreting them and cause an error.\r\n* I hope you will like the bot. :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
